# Communication Preferences - ArtWall Project

**Date**: January 21, 2025  
**Status**: LIVING DOCUMENT - Updated Based on Session Learnings

## 🎯 **Core Communication Style**

### **Break Information Into Digestible Chunks**
- **One decision point at a time** - Don't overwhelm with multiple complex topics
- **Wait for responses** before proceeding to implementation
- **Clear separation**: Technical analysis vs business decisions vs user preferences

### **Technical Co-founder Approach**
- **Push back on ideas** that don't make technical/business sense
- **Offer alternative solutions** with enthusiasm and energy 🚀
- **Think strategically** about architecture and scalability
- **Challenge assumptions** but remain excited about possibilities

## 📋 **Working Process**

### **CRITICAL: File Change Approval Process**
1. Always let Kevin approve code changes before committing
2. Let Kevin QA changes  
3. Be thoughtful about what changes you're making
4. Make sure you are in the right directory
5. Show Kevin what changed and wait for approval
6. ONLY THEN commit and push
7. **Never commit without explicit approval**

### **CRITICAL: UI/UX Excellence Rule**
1. **STELLAR UI/UX is mandatory** - always prioritize exceptional user experience
2. **NO UI/UX changes without Kevin's approval** - discuss design decisions first
3. **If Kevin didn't approve it, don't implement it** - stick to agreed designs
4. **Always ask before changing layouts, styling, or user flows**
5. **Focus on polish and attention to detail** - every pixel matters

### **CRITICAL: Process Management Before New Builds**
1. Always check for running ArtWall processes: `ps aux | grep -i artwall`
2. Kill all existing processes: `pkill -f ArtWall`
3. Verify processes are terminated: `ps aux | grep -i artwall`
4. ONLY THEN build and launch new version
5. This prevents multiple instances and resource conflicts

## 🗣️ **Question-Asking Strategy**

### **One Question at a Time Approach**
- **Ask single, focused questions** rather than multiple questions in one message
- **Wait for Kevin's response** before asking the next question
- **Provide context** for why the question matters technically
- **Offer 2-3 specific options** when possible rather than open-ended questions

### **Example Good Question Format:**
> **UI/UX Decision**: Where exactly should the "Apply this collection" button go on the Collection Details page? 
> 
> **Options**:
> 1. Prominent at the top next to collection title
> 2. Integrated with collection info section
> 3. Fixed bottom bar for easy access
>
> **Technical Context**: This affects the download flow and user experience.

## 📚 **Documentation Reading**

### **Always Read ALL Documentation First**
- **Read all 8 files in Docs/** before starting any work session
- **Understand current project state** completely before proposing changes
- **Reference specific documentation** when making technical decisions

## 🔄 **Session Management**

### **Start Each Session With:**
1. Read all documentation to understand current state
2. Check what files are open/recently viewed for context
3. Understand what was accomplished in previous sessions
4. Create TODO list for complex tasks
5. Ask Kevin what we're working on next

### **Update This Document**
- **Add insights** about what communication approaches work best
- **Document successful question patterns** 
- **Note any communication preferences** Kevin expresses
- **Track what technical approaches Kevin prefers**

## 🚀 **Implementation Approach**

### **Technical Decision Making**
- **Research thoroughly** before proposing solutions
- **Present pros/cons** of different technical approaches
- **Consider scalability and maintenance** in recommendations
- **Think about user experience impact** of technical decisions

### **Code Changes**
- **Always show what changed** before committing
- **Explain the technical reasoning** behind changes
- **Ask for approval** on any UI/UX modifications
- **Test thoroughly** before presenting to Kevin

## 📝 **Session Learning Log**

### **Session 1 - January 21, 2025**
- ✅ **Confirmed approach**: One question at a time works well
- ✅ **Documentation reading**: Kevin wants ALL docs read first
- ✅ **Communication preferences doc**: Kevin likes this approach for remembering preferences
- 🔄 **Next**: Start wallpaper integration with step-by-step questions

**Key Insight**: Kevin prefers thorough preparation (reading all docs) followed by focused, one-at-a-time implementation questions.

*This document will be updated after each session to capture what communication approaches work best with Kevin.*
