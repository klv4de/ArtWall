The painting was part of Paul Gauguin’s own collection, and here he proprietarily signed his name over its white frame. Of the five or six Cézannes that he acquired while still a banker, this was the one he claimed he would never part with, “except in a case of direst necessity.” (He would eventually sell it to pay for medical treatment in Tahiti.) Although the version in this painting is nearly to scale with the original, it is more a translation than a copy, with rhythmical arabesques that are characteristic of Gauguin’s painting style rather than Cézanne’s.</p>\n<p>This is one of thirty-five works that comprise the Winterbotham Collection. <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/the-winterbotham-collection\">Click here to learn more about the collection.</a></p>\n",

The artist was struck by the area’s dramatic, untamed landscape, particularly its beaches’ sweeping dunes and wind-bent trees, which dominate this picture. He emphasized the power of nature by including a tiny human figure among the dunes. Seeking to convey the sensations of the environment without being overly representational, Sérusier composed the picture with fields of pure, bold color and strong lines. This style, called synthetism, was also championed by <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artists/34611/paul-gauguin\">Paul Gauguin</a>.</p>\n",

Palmer requested Swedish portraitist Anders Zorn for this painting because his impressionistic style was in keeping with her taste as a collector, which was considered radical at the time.

He also revisited an Impressionist subject that his colleagues had all but abandoned by the 1890s—the modern city. This bustling scene, alive with the noise and movement of traffic and pedestrians, was the view from his window at the Hôtel Garnier in Paris, where he stayed for a few weeks early in 1893.

On each occasion he chose a similar vantage looking down on the small structure, which appears to grow out of the cliffside. The dimensions of this version are nearly identical to those of the other three canvases from the second visit. Here, Monet increased the amount of white in his paints to capture more nuanced atmospheric effects. He also experimented with techniques to animate the surface, at times scraping down or wiping away the still-soft paint to expose underlying colors. In the water, for example, breaks in the pale-gray paint reveal a bright green beneath, which the artist accentuated with additional touches of a similar green on top.</p>\n",

The group believed that painting should be decorative as opposed to purely representational. As a result, they sought formats and approaches that departed from traditional easel painting.</p>\n",
