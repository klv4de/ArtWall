      "description": "<p>Brutal tormentors surround the suffering figure of Jesus as he carries his cross to Calvary, the site of his crucifixion. In the upper-left corner, his mother, Mary, and her companion are also reviled by the crowd. Like many German Late Gothic images of Christ‚Äôs Passion, this painting reflects the prophetic words of Psalm 22, which describe how Jesus will be persecuted with ridiculing facial expressions, offensive gestures, and physical torture. The panel was probably intended as a focal point for individual meditation, perhaps as part of a small, portable altarpiece. It is the only surviving panel painting by an artist whose expressive style was highly influential in Southern Germany in the early 15th century.</p>\n",

      "description": "<p>Bernat Martorell was the greatest painter of the first half of the fifteenth century in Catalonia in northeastern Spain. Depicted here is the most frequently represented episode from the popular legend of Saint George, in which the model Christian knight saves a town and rescues a beautiful princess. Conceived in the elegant, decorative International Gothic style, the painting was originally the center of an altarpiece dedicated to Saint George that was apparently made for the chapel of the palace of the Catalan government in Barcelona. This central scene was surrounded by four smaller narrative panels, now in the Mus√©e du Louvre, Paris, and was probably surmounted by a lost image of Christ on the Cross. Here Saint George, on his white steed, triumphs over the evil dragon. A wealth of precisely observed details intensifies the drama. Dressed in an ermine-lined robe, the princess wears a sumptuous gilt crown atop her wavy red-gold hair. Her parents and their subjects watch the spectacle from the distant town walls. George‚Äôs halo and armor and the scaly body of the dragon are richly modeled with raised stucco decoration. Martorell also treated the ground, littered with bones and crawling with lizards, in a lively manner, giving it a gritty texture.</p>\n",

      "description": "<p>Hans Memling probably worked with Rogier van der Weyden in Brussels before settling in Bruges in 1465. Van der Weyden was well known for his exquisite devotional diptychs, and Memling was influenced by his work, though he made his paired paintings more realistic by setting the figures in a measurable domestic space. This portrait of the unidentified patron and the image of the <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artworks/16295\"><em>Virgin and Child</em></a> were separated many years ago; they were reunited at the Art Institute of Chicago in 1953. Unfortunately, <em>Portrait of a Man in Prayer</em> is in very poor condition; much better preserved is the image <em>Saint Anthony of Padua</em>, presumably the sitter‚Äôs patron saint, on the reverse of the portrait.  The saint was painted in subdued tones of gray, in imitation of stone, a convention often used on the backs of Netherlandish altarpieces.  Anthony of Padua, an important early follower of Saint Francis, was more popular in Italy, Spain and Portugal than in the Low Countries, hence the diptych may have been made for a member of the large foreign community in Bruges.</p>\n",

Carlo Crivelli enhanced the morbidness of the scene by depicting Jesus as emaciated and puffy-eyed, his mouth agape, with blood dripping from his wounds. As subtle hints towards his eventual victory over death, wind animates his loincloth and inflates the sail of a boat in the distance, while verdant plants shoot up from cracks in the rocky, arid terrain. Crivelli‚Äôs unique style, vividly graphic and marrying the beautiful with the grotesque, has long captivated audiences.</p>\n",

The intimate presentation of the holy figures and Christ‚Äôs gesture of blessing suggest that this small painting served a private devotional function. This supposition is supported by the choice of format, since a Florentine patron would have typically commissioned a circular painting, or tondo, for use in a bedchamber.</p>\n",

Paris wears the garb of a contemporary knight rather than classical dress, a choice that emphasizes the enduring relevance of his moral crossroads as well as, through contrast, the nudity of the goddesses. His sleeping pose and the painting‚Äôs inscription, <em>PARIS / TRA(U)M</em> (‚Äúdream of Paris,‚Äù on the slip of paper attached to the tree), indicate that he is in the midst of a dream vision, a poetic device carried over from medieval allegory and used to foreshadow future events in a narrative.
