Here, John the Baptist offers plums to the infant Jesus, who eagerly devours one while another lies half-eaten on the ground. At right, Saint Cecilia, patron of musicians, sings from a book of music, while wingless angels look on in the background.</p>\n<p>The shadowed effect in the figures surrounding the Virgin and Child indicate that Piero altered his plans for the composition after he had begun painting: the artist painted them on top of the dark background color, which shows through the thin layers of paint on the surface.</p>\n",

One of Ridolfo’s most celebrated pictures, this work reveals his careful study of the portraits of Leonardo da Vinci and Raphael in its calm, pyramidal, and expansive presentation of the sitter and in its active, searching light. The foreground parapet, or ledge, over which a hand projects illusionistically into the viewer’s space and the glimpse of landscape through the window are devices Ridolfo borrowed from Flemish painting. The headpiece (<em>cappuccio</em>) and fur-cuffed robe of the unidentified sitter were customary apparel for well-to-do Florentine merchants.</p>\n",

      "description": "<p>The young Baccio della Porta came under the spell of the charismatic Dominican friar Girolamo Savonarola, joining his monastic order as Fra (Friar) Bartolommeo in 1500 and forsaking his painting career for several years. Returning to painting in 1504, he looked to the most lyrical and harmonious recent works of Leonardo da Vinci, Raphael, and Michelangelo to form his own style, which was characterized by a new, quiet spirituality. The palette of saturated blue, red, and green announces the Holy Family, while the muted tones of the angels’ garments establish an otherworldly presence. Here he treated the Nativity in a traditional, though especially intimate, manner. The Virgin kneels humbly as she gazes at the Christ Child, while Joseph assumes a pose of restrained wonderment, as if suddenly aware of the infant’s divine nature. The family shelters in a rustic stall erected within the ruins of an edifice understood to be the palace of David at Bethlehem. This juxtaposition of architecture symbolizes Christ’s establishment of his new church on the Old Testament order of the Jews. Reinforcing this device is a young tree springing from a remnant of ancient stones directly above the infant.</p>\n",

      "description": "<p>Once thought to be by the young Albrecht Altdorfer, this painting is instead the work of a painter named after a winged altarpiece in the town of Pulkau, near the Austrian and Moravian border. Though the artist takes his name from the Pulkau altarpiece, he was probably active in Vienna. Like other loosely associated South German and Austrian artists of the early 16th century, who are now grouped together as the Danube School, the Master of Pulkau used exuberant natural forms to give a heightened emotional quality to his work. In this altarpiece wing, the swirling vegetation, excited angels, and oversized Virgin and animals direct the viewer’s attention to the vulnerable Christ Child, who is the focus of adoration.</p>\n",

      "description": "<p>This painting represents one of the most popular compositions invented by one of the most distinguished painters working in Rome during the High Renaissance. In the 1510s, following an early period in Venice, Sebastiano del Piombo traveled to Rome, where he was drawn into the lively atmosphere of competition between the two great luminaries of the period, <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artists/33808/michelangelo-buonarroti\">Michelangelo Buonarroti</a> and <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artists/36321/raphael\">Raphael</a>. Michelangelo took Sebastiano under his wing, teaching him his monumental style and providing drawings for some of Sebastiano’s major commissions. Following Raphael’s death in 1520, the painter and historian <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artists/37130/giorgio-vasari\">Giorgio Vasari</a> stated that “first place in the art of painting was unanimously granted by all, thanks to the favor of Michelangelo, to Sebastiano.”</p>\n<p><em>Christ Carrying the Cross</em> draws upon recent developments of an enormously popular iconography by artists including <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artists/33587/giovanni-bellini\">Giovanni Bellini</a>, <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artists/34665/giorgione\">Giorgione</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artists/35584/andrea-mantegna\">Andrea Mantegna</a>, among others. Here, Simon of Cyrene assists Jesus, emphasizing the heavy weight of the cross on his shoulders. A Roman soldier stands behind, his jeering face just visible in the darkness. In the background, the tightly packed composition opens up onto a crowd assembling at the foot of the hill of Golgotha, with two crosses barely visible. The luminous landscape is a hallmark of the artist’s Venetian training. The painting’s dramatic visual impact is a result of the powerful diagonals of the cross; the dynamic, almost sculptural quality of Christ’s clothing; and the pathos of his expression.</p>\n<p>The popularity of Sebastiano’s composition is reflected in the number of surviving variants that he created over the course of his career. The Art Institute’s version is an autograph replica of a painting—now in the Museo del Prado, Madrid—made for Jerónimo Vich y Valterra, the Spanish ambassador to Rome. Other versions survive in the State Hermitage Museum, Saint Petersburg; the Monasterio de las Descalzas Reales, Madrid; and the Szépmüvészeti Múzeum, Budapest.</p>\n",

The artist rendered the mountains, valleys, rivers, and villages in successive bands of brown, green, and blue, the typical structure of the independent landscape that first emerged as a genre in this period. The roads that wind through the scene—metaphors for the journey of life—were a popular motif in Flemish painting and likely helped this work appeal to the growing number of art collectors in the booming city of Antwerp, a center of international trade.</p>\n",

This intimate work was painted for the Estes and adorned the oratory chapel of their palace. In the painting, Saint Luke draws the Virgin and Child while Saint Joseph watches unobtrusively from a doorway. As in many Renaissance works, Christ appears agitated—seemingly possessing foreknowledge of his death. He may be reacting to the spearlike yarnwinder, an attribute of the Three Fates and, consequently, a traditional symbol of death.</p>\n<p>After leaving the Estes, the painting came into the possession, successively, of two Roman cardinals, two Roman princes, the English Duke of Westminster, Baron Alfred de Rothschild, and the Earl of Carnavon, who famously paid for the excavation of the tomb of King Tutankhamen.</p>\n",

      "description": "<p>Trained in the Dutch Republic before making his career in London, Pieter van Roestraeten specialized in compositions populated with luxury goods crafted from rare, imported materials like those seen here. On the right stands a lidded agate cup with detailed silver mounts, counterbalanced to the left of the grouping by another cup, which has been overturned to reveal its mother-of-pearl lining. A piece of valuable and versatile coral, sourced from the coasts of Italy and France, dangles over the front edge of the table. The central item in this still life, the ostrich egg cup, is in the collection of the Art Institute. Known as the <a href=\" https://www.artic.edu/artworks/198902/ostrich-cup\"> Whitfield Cup</a>, it was created in 1590 by the royal jeweler John Spilman.</p>\n",

      "description": "<p>Edwaert Collier was well known in his own time for his still lifes, which replicated in intricate detail actual maps and globes. Here, he reproduced a portion of Frederik de Wit’s 1660 map of the Americas and Jodocus Hondius’s terrestrial globe with a view of Mexico, both of which allude to the Dutch Republic’s international trade networks and the ambition to possess the world through cartographic knowledge. The extinguished candle and hourglass, in contrast, reference the fleeting nature of time. Through such highly illusionistic renderings of the symbols of worldly pursuits, Collier evoked the tension between humanity’s lasting contributions to the fields of art and science and the brevity of an individual life.</p>\n",

Polycrates, ruler of the island of Samos, worried that he was tempting fate with his great prosperity. He tried to introduce some counterbalancing misfortune into his life by throwing a precious signet ring into the sea, but it was swallowed by a large fish and returned to the king by a fisherman, the episode shown here. Polycrates’s good fortune came to an end when he was entrapped by Oroetus of Sardis and put to death, the event illustrated in <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artworks/44829/polycrates-crucifixion\"><em>Polycrates’ Crucifixion</em></a>.</p>\n",

      "description": "<p>A native of Naples, Salvator Rosa settled in Rome in 1649, producing dramatic works regarded as counterparts to the calm, classical landscapes of his contemporaries <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artists/31257/claude-lorrain\">Claude Lorrain</a> and <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artists/36259/nicolas-poussin\">Nicolas Poussin</a>. Rosa’s landscapes present nature as wild, filled with striking effects of light, jagged cliffs, and dark grottoes. These qualities underline the eerie mood in his depiction of the death of Polycrates, ruler of the Greek island of Samos. Together with its companion piece <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artworks/44826/polycrates-and-the-fisherman\"><em>Polycrates and the Fisherman</em></a>, it illustrates the king’s inability to escape the ups and downs of fortune to which all humans are subject.</p>\n",
