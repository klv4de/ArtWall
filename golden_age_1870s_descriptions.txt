11723|Woman at Her Toilette|<p>Consistent with the Impressionist aesthetic that Berthe Morisot fervently espoused, <em>Woman at Her Toilette</em> attempts to capture the essence of modern life in summary, understated terms. The painting also moves discreetly into the realm of female eroticism explored by Edgar Degas, Édouard Manet, and Pierre-Auguste Renoir but seldom broached at this time by women artists. Rendered with soft, feathery brushstrokes in nuanced shades of lavender, pink, blue, white, and gray, the composition resembles a visual tone poem, orchestrated with such perfumed and rarified motifs as brushed blonde hair, satins, powder puffs, and ﬂower petals. The artist even signed her name along the bottom of the mirror, as if to suggest that the image in her painting is as ephemeral as a silvery reﬂection. Morisot exhibited in seven of the eight Impressionist group shows; this painting was included in the fifth exhibition, in 1880, where her work received great acclaim. She was a particularly close friend of and frequent model for Manet, and she married his younger brother Eugène the year before she completed this painting. In addition to domestic interiors such as this one, Morisot’s pictorial realm included studies of women and children, gardens, fields, and seaside vacation homes.</p>

14556|Auvers, Panoramic View|<p>Paul Cezanne made this work during his first prolonged stay at Auvers, where he was mentored by Impressionist painter <a href="https://www.artic.edu/collection?artist_ids=Camille+Pissarro">Camille Pissarro</a>. Cezanne rendered the unusual perspective—looking down onto the rooftops of Auvers and out to the distant countryside—using blocky, energetic patches of color and areas of ragged brushwork that seem unfinished, especially at the lower left and center. These choices, which were radical at the time, mark his attempt to communicate not merely the landscape’s appearance but also the feeling of seeing it and painting it.</p>

14574|Henri Degas and His Niece Lucie Degas (The Artist's Uncle and Cousin)|<p>Edgar Degas was the most subtle portrait painter in the Impressionist group. His portraits, mostly of family members and close friends, were executed primarily in the period from the late 1850s through the 1870s. During frequent visits to Florence and Naples, Degas recorded his Italian relatives with great candor. On one of his last trips to Naples, in the mid-1870s, Degas painted this double portrait of his orphaned first cousin, Lucie, and their uncle Henri, in whose care the girl had recently been placed. In this painting, Degas showed two people, separated by many years in age, who are tentatively accepting the circumstances of their new relationship. Degas, having recently lost his own father and having witnessed other family misfortunes, addressed subjects such as this with awareness and sensitivity.</p>
<p>Areas of thin paint and unresolved details suggest that the painting was never completed. But the spare treatment of the background effectively emphasizes the heads and upper portions of the figures. Their connection is expressed in the similar tilt of their heads and in the black mourning clothes they both wear. Their psychological discomfort is suggested by the contrast of the plain wall behind Lucie and the darker glass-and-wood French door behind Henri, as well as by the curved chair back against which the man sits and on which the girl leans. At once intimate and distant, casual and guarded, these two relatives, and the third relation who paints them from the other side of the paper-laden table, poignantly express the fragility and necessity of family ties.</p>

14594|Portrait of a Woman with a Black Fichu|<p>Using just a few brushstrokes, Manet gave a full sense of this unidentified sitter’s jovial personality. Her amused half-smile may speak to a pleasant exchange between artist and model. This painting offers valuable insight into Manet’s working process. He initially blocked out the figure with dark, painted lines and then moved on to short, precise strokes in the costume and face. Finally, he applied a thinned green wash that was likely the first step toward patterned background, left unfinished.</p>
<p>The woman’s coiffure, a pile of blue-black hair with curly bangs, helps date this work to the late 1870s.</p>

16551|Beata Beatrix|<p>Both a poet and a painter, Dante Gabriel Rossetti was a founder of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, a circle of Victorian artists who were united in their regard for medieval aesthetics. Named after the thirteenth-century poet Dante Alighieri, Rossetti found inspiration for <em>Beata Beatrix</em> in his namesake’s <em>La vita nuova (The New Life</em>; 1295). Rossetti’s scene draws a parallel between Dante’s love for the late Beatrice and his own affection for his recently deceased wife and muse, Elizabeth Siddal. While this picture is a tribute to Siddal, Rossetti was adamant that it does not represent her death. Rather, the work portrays her as if in a trance or altered spiritual state.</p>
<p>Rossetti’s symbolism combines details from his personal life with those from <em>La Vita Nuova</em>. “The Dove” was the artist’s nickname for Siddal, and a haloed dove delivers her a white poppy, a symbol of laudanum—a derivative of opium—which caused her death by overdose. Above rises the Ponte Vecchio, the Florentine bridge that served as the setting of Dante’s poem. To the upper left is the personification of Love and to the right the figure of Dante, who doubles as a representation of Rossetti himself. The sundial shadows the number nine, the age Dante first saw Beatrice as well as the hour and day of her death. Rossetti designed the frame, and at the top right he inscribed, “How doth the city sit solitary.” This quote from <em>La Vita Nuova</em> refers to the city of Florence’s mourning of Beatrice.</p>
<p>Given the deeply personal nature of the work, Rossetti initially refused his patron William Graham’s request to create a replica, although he eventually yielded. The Art Institute’s painting is this second version, which is the only one to have a predella—the painted scene at the bottom of the frame—depicting Beatrice and Dante’s reunion in paradise. With this addition, Rossetti provides the medieval love story with a happy conclusion, perhaps suggesting that he, too, had begun to come to terms with his own profound grief.</p>

18951|Yellow Dancers (In the Wings)|<p>Edgar Degas first painted dancers as an independent subject in 1871. He was to devote almost half his output as an artist to this subject, observing countless performances and rehearsals at the Paris Opéra. Here he placed the viewer in the wings, as if among the elite Opéra subscribers who roamed and socialized backstage. Dance subjects allowed Degas to contemporize his lifelong interest in showing the human body in complex movement, shifting the scene from ancient history to modern Paris. He finished and signed the present canvas in time for the second Impressionist exhibition, in April 1876.</p>

100352|African Chief|<p>Although this appears to be a portrait rendered quickly from direct observation, it is in fact an imagined representation of an African chief. Working in Paris, Mariano Fortuny y  Marsal referenced elements from different cultures to construct this fictional scene, which is based on sketches he made and objects he collected while traveling in North Africa. The figure carries items from that region, such as the <em>kabyle</em> musket slung across his shoulders and a <em>haik</em>, the white outer garment encircling his head, neck, and lower body. The <em>pata</em> (gauntlet sword) and powder flask hanging from his waist, however, are of Indian origin.</p>
